# Prerequisites

- .NET Core
- Mongo DB

# To Begin :
1. please download the project to your local machine.
2. open the project in Visual Studio.
3. open your Mongo DB  and when you connect to Mongo DB you need to see the "conntion string"
4. copy the connection strint
5. paste the "conntion string" in : appsettings.json there is setting there... (see:ConnectionString)
6. Creating tables in Mongo:
I am very sorry, you will have to create tables in Mongo DB yourself.
with overlapping fields for classes in the Models folder

Now you can add values in the Swagger 
and they will be updated in the database. 
Note that you must enter logical and correct data because otherwise the data will not enter the database.

Successfully !
